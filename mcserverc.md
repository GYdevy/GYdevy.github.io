# Minecraft Server in C

A lightweight Minecraft 1.15.2 server written in C, built entirely from scratch using POSIX TCP sockets and manual packet handling. The project implements core server functions—login, world spawning, player movement, and chat—by directly following the Minecraft protocol.

## Key Learnings

- Developed low-level network programming skills with TCP/IP
- Gained hands-on experience in manual packet serialization and deserialization
- Explored protocol structures and real-time multiplayer event handling
- Built a solid foundation for networking and protocol-based systems
